.SYNOPSIS
Powershell script to schedule a System reboot for next 10 seconds

.DESCRIPTION
it is needed because PAWS uses Ansible to drive powershell execution and for
Ansible version 2.1.1.0 when it was tested I did not figure out how to
do a async calls through Ansible on powershell module.
If the restart is executed right away Ansible will process the call as
failed rc != 0 returning and code different than 0

.REQUIREMENTS
Windows Porwshell 3 or greater

.TESTED
Windows 2012 R2
